# A* Algorithm Implementation

This application will calculate the shortest path from the source to the destination as entered by the user, 
and navigate past obstacles, using an A* Algorithm and built using C++ and SFML.


### Instructions
As explained by the onscreen instructions, begin by entering the source tile position, followed by the goal/destination using the mouse and left click.
Next, while holding down the left mouse button, select the tiles for the obstacles.
When all obstacles have been entered, press spacebar to run the A* Algorithm pathfinding.
If no path can be found, no path will be shown and the console will reiterate this.
Press R at any time to restart the program.
